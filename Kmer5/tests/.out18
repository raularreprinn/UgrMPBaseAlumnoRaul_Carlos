ERROR in CLASSIFY parameters
Run with the following parameters:
CLASSIFY [-k kValue] [-n nucleotidesSet] <file.dna> <profile1.prf> [<profile2.prf> <profile3.prf> ....]

Parameters:
-k kValue: number of nucleotides in a kmer (5 by default)
-n nucletiodesSet: set of possible nucleotides in a kmer (ACGT by default). It is used when learning a model for <file.dna>. Note that the characters should be provided in uppercase
<profile1.prf> [<profile2.prf> <profile3.prf> ....] ....: names of the Profile models (at least one is mandatory)

This program obtains the identifier of the closest profile to the input DNA file
