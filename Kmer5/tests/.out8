ERROR in LEARN parameters
Run with the following parameters:
LEARN [-t|-b] [-k kValue] [-n nucleotidesSet] [-p profileId] [-o outputFilename] <file1.dna> [<file2.dna> <file3.dna> .... ]

Parameters:
-t|-b: text mode or binary mode for the output file (-t by default)
-k kValue: number of nucleotides in a kmer (5 by default)
-n nucleotidesSet: set of possible nucleotides in a kmer (ACGT by default). Note that the characters should be provided in uppercase
-p profileId: profile identifier (unknown by default)
-o outputFilename: name of the output file (output.prf by default)
<file1.dna> <file2.dna> <file3.dna> ....: names of the input files (at least one is mandatory)

This program learns a profile model from a set of input DNA files <file1.dna> <file2.dna> <file3.dna> ....
